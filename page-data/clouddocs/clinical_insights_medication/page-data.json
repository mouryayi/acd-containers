In addition to a _score_ and _usage_ section, adverseEvent also has an _allergyScore_ that indicates if the given AE is just an allergy mention.\n\nYou can use the usage scores to carve very specific boundaries around the kinds of medication mentions that you surface in your application.  For example, depending on your use case, you may want to know about when a dose change occurred, but not when it was just mentioned as a consideration.\n\n## modifiers\n\nWhen the medication model runs and determines that a medication is involved in an adverse event, it will then run an additional linking model to decide which nearby diagnoses or abnormal findings may have been caused by the adverse event.  Those linkages are added as _associatedAdverseEvents_ in the _modifiers_ list. An example is shown below.\n\n### Sample Response\n\nConsider the following sample text.\n\n_If she is able to get her fasting blood glucose down, we may be able to take her off of Metformin._\n\nThe clinical insight features for Metformin might look as follows:\n\n```\n\"insightModelData\": {\n\t\"medication\": {\n\t\t\"usage\": {\n\t\t\t\"takenScore\": 1,\n\t\t\t\"consideringScore\": 0,\n\t\t\t\"discussedScore\": 0,\n\t\t\t\"labMeasurementScore\": 0\n\t\t},\n\t\t\"startedEvent\": {\n\t\t\t\"score\": 0,\n\t\t\t\"usage\": {\n\t\t\t\t\"explicitScore\": 0,\n\t\t\t\t\"consideringScore\": 0,\n\t\t\t\t\"discussedScore\": 0\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t},\n\t\t\"stoppedEvent\": {\n\t\t\t\"score\": 1,\n\t\t\t\"usage\": {\n\t\t\t\t\"explicitScore\": 0.126,\n\t\t\t\t\"consideringScore\": 0.874,\n\t\t\t\t\"discussedScore\": 0\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t},\n\t\t\"doseChangedEvent\": {\n\t\t\t\"score\": 0,\n\t\t\t\"usage\": {\n\t\t\t\t\"explicitScore\": 0,\n\t\t\t\t\"consideringScore\": 0,\n\t\t\t\t\"discussedScore\": 0\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t},\n\t\t\"adverseEvent\": {\n\t\t\t\"score\": 0,\n\t\t\t\"allergyScore\": 0,\n\t\t\t\"usage\": {\n\t\t\t\t\"explicitScore\": 0,\n\t\t\t\t\"consideringScore\": 0,\n\t\t\t\t\"discussedScore\": 0\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t}\n\t}\n}\n```\n\nExample of _associatedAdverseEvents_: if an adverse event is detected, the adverse event link model will create linkages to the diagnoses or abnormal findings involved as appropriate.
