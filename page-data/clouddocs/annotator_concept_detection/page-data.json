The service provides concepts based on the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS). As of the 2018AA version of the UMLS library, the consumers can elect to have a set of [medical codes](/clouddocs/medical_codes/) associated with the UMLS concepts by specifying the optional configuration parameter to return the medical codes. When medical codes are requested, the UMLS concept annotations from concept detection will include the applicable medical codes as metadata within the annotations.\n\n## Expanded Concepts\n\nConcept detection provides an _expanded_ option that allows you to go beyond exact matching of surface forms in a dictionary. With **expanded** set to `true`, concept detection will learn from the dictionary entries you have specified and generalize to other ways that concepts can be expressed in text. This allows you to define a core set of surface forms without exhaustively listing every surface form for every concept. This becomes particularly important with compound ideas. Consider the following text:\n\n`The patient broke his leg and hip when he fell outside his home.`\n\nThere are two different injuries expressed in this text that we want to capture - broken leg and broken hip.  Neither one will have a dictionary entry that covers the way the concept is expressed. In this example, concept detection would return the following concepts with **expanded** set `true`.\n\n```\n{\n    \"cui\": \"C0159852\",\n    \"preferredName\": \"Fracture of tibia and fibula\",\n    \"semanticType\": \"inpo\",\n    \"source\": \"umls-expanded\",\n    \"sourceVersion\": \"2018AA\",\n    \"type\": \"umls.InjuryOrPoisoning\",\n    \"begin\": 12,\n    \"end\": 25,\n    \"coveredText\": \"broke his leg\",\n    \"icd10Code\": \"S82.90X?\",\n    \"snomedConceptId\": \"414293001\",\n    \"vocabs\": \"MTH,CHV,CCS,ICD9CM,SNOMEDCT_US,ICPC\"\n}\n\n...\n\n{\n    \"cui\": \"C0019557\",\n    \"preferredName\": \"Hip Fractures\",\n    \"semanticType\": \"inpo\",\n    \"source\": \"umls-expanded\",\n    \"sourceVersion\": \"2018AA\",\n    \"type\": \"umls.InjuryOrPoisoning\",\n    \"begin\": 12,\n    \"end\": 33,\n    \"coveredText\": \"broke his leg and hip\",\n    \"loincId\": \"MTHU020794\",\n    \"icd10Code\": \"S72.009?\",\n    \"nciCode\": \"C26794,C35153\",\n    \"snomedConceptId\": \"5913000,263225007\",\n    \"meshId\": \"M0010366\",\n    \"vocabs\": \"MTH,CHV,LNC,CSP,MSH,NCI,AOD,NCI_CTCAE,NDFRT,COSTAR,SNOMEDCT_US,DXP\"\n}\n```\n\nExpanded detection will look for diseases, conditions, abnormalities, injuries, and procedures defined in the UMLS dictionary that ships with IBM Clinical Data Annotator.\nIn addition, expanded detection will look for all of the concepts defined in custom dictionaries that are enabled for expanded detection in the cartridge configuration.\n\n### Configurations\n\nThe following table lists parameters of the concept_detection service.\n\n| Configuration | Values | Description |\n|:--------------|--------|-------------|\n| Libraries | <ul><li>umls.latest</li><li>umls.2021AA</li><li>umls.2020AA</li><li>umls.2019AA <i>(deprecated - will be removed in 2022)</i></li></ul> | Defines the version of the UMLS library that is used when analyzing unstructured data.* |\n| inference_rules | | The name of a derived concept rule set that will be used for deriving additional concepts based on the concepts discovered by the libraries specified. |\n| filters | | The name of a concept filter that is used to remove unwanted concepts. |\n| expanded | true/false | When true, the concept detection annotator will attempt to expand concept coverage beyond the surface forms explicitly listed in the specified library.  For example - if <q>broken collarbone</q> is a surface from for C0159658 (Fracture of clavicle), the expanded option would match textual representations of that concept like <q>broke my collarbone</q>.  This option is <i>false</i> by default. |\n| include_optional_fields | medical_codes / source_vocabularies | Optional fields that should also be returned for each concept. If not specified, only the libary's default fields will be returned. |\n| longest_span | true/false | When true <i>(default)</i>, only the concept with the longest text span will be returned if there are multiple concepts overlapping the same span of text. |\n\n*The value `umls.latest` will reference the latest available version of UMLS within the service. As newer versions of UMLS are made available in the service, `umls.latest` library configurations will automatically leverage the latest available version of UMLS in the service once available. Declaration of a specific version of UMLS is recommended to avoid undesirable changes in output as newer versions of UMLS are made available within the service. Through declaration of a specific version of UMLS, newer versions of UMLS may be evaluated prior to use in production.\n\n#### Annotation Types\n\n* Concept\n\n#### Concept\n\n| Fields | Description |\n|:-------|:------------|\n| cui | Concept Unique ID (CUI).
