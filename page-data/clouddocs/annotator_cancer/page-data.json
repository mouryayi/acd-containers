The smallest possible start position is 0. |\n| end | The end position of the annotation as character offset into the text. The end position points at the first character after the annotation, such that end-begin equals the length of the coveredText. |\n| coveredText | The text covered by an annotation as a string. |\n| type | aci.IcaCancerDiagnosisInd |\n| modality | Potenial values are: `positive` and `negative`.  This based on whether the patient has or does not have the cancer identified. |\n| sectionSurfaceForm | Medical documents have many sections such as patient's information, previous medical history, family history, etc.  The covered text that identifies which section of the document that spans the annotation. The default value of this feature is `document`. |\n| cancer | See aci.Cancer table below. |\n| date | See aci.Date table below. |\n| measurement | See aci.Measurement table below. |\n| CancerGrade | See aci.CancerGrade table below. |\n| site | See aci.SiteInd table below. |\n\nSubtypes for aci.IcaCancerDiagnosisInd\n\n#### aci.Cancer\n\n| Feature | Description |\n|:--------|-------------|\n| begin | The start position of the annotation as a character offset into the text.

For example, in the text `He has lung cancer`, the cancerSurfaceForm is `lung cancer`. |\n| cancerNormalizedName |  Normalized name for the cancer from the UMLS dictionary   For example, in the text `He has lung cancer`, the cancerSurfaceForm is `primary malignant neoplasm of lung`. |\n| ccsCode | CCS stands for Clinical Classification System, used to categorize diagnosis and procedures such that it can be used for further analysis. |\n| hccCode | HCC stands for Hierarchical Condition Categories and primarily used by Medicare and Medicaid. |\n| icd9Code | ICD stands for International Classification of Diseases.  The number 9 is a revision number for this code set. |\n| icd10Code | ICD stands for International Classification of Diseases.  The number 10 is a revision number for this code set. |\n| snomedConceptId | Numerical code provided by the SNOMED dictionaries that represents the cancer. |\n| cui | UMLS Concept Unique ID (CUI). CUIs are used to uniquely identify concepts across different UMLS sources. Depending on the source of the cancer information, this value may not be available. |\n| morphologyCode | A value that describes the behavior of cancer from malignant to benign. |\n| behavior | The code represents the type of growth such as benign, malignant, in situ, or uncertain.  This code only applies to cancer related disease.
