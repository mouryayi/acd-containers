The smallest possible start position is 0. |\n| end | The end position of the temporal entity as a character offset into the text. The end position points at the first character after the annotation, such that end-begin equals the length of the coveredText. |\n| temportalType | Provides information about the type of a temporal entity.

For example, in the image above _2/10_ in the context of the patient's current pain level scores low as a date and is not surfaced. |\n| relationType | Provides information about how the temporal entity relates to an entity.  Currently, _overlapsScore_ is the only relation type defined and it indicates how strongly the temporal entity is linked to the concept. |\n\nTemporal features\n\n```\n\"begin\": 585,\n\"end\": 596,\n\"coveredText\": \"hip surgery\",\n\"negated\": false,\n\"insightModelData\": {\n     \"procedure\": {\n         \"usage\": {\n             \"explicitScore\": 0.999,\n             \"pendingScore\": 0,\n             \"discussedScore\": 0\n         },\n         \"task\": {\n             \"therapeuticScore\": 1,\n             \"diagnosticScore\": 0,\n             \"labTestScore\": 0,\n             \"surgicalTaskScore\": 0,\n             \"clinicalAssessmentScore\": 0\n         },\n         \"type\": {\n             \"deviceScore\": 0,\n             \"materialScore\": 0,\n             \"medicationScore\": 0,\n             \"procedureScore\": 1,\n             \"conditionManagementScore\": 0\n         }\n     }\n },\n \"temporal\": [\n     {\n         \"begin\": 600,\n         \"end\": 604,\n         \"coveredText\": \"5/17\",\n         \"temporalType\": {\n             \"dateScore\": 1\n         },\n         \"relationTypes\": {\n             \"overlapsScore\": 0.996\n         }\n     }\n ]\n```\n\nIt is possible for multiple temporal links to be added to a concept.
