If your cartridge deployment request times out, here are steps you can take to verify successful deployment after giving the process about 15 minutes to complete.\n\n* For initial deployment of a cartridge, you can look for the creation of the default annotator flow to determine whether deployment has completed. The default annotator flow is the last artifact created during the deployment process and its existence signals completion of deployment in the initial deployment of a cartridge.\n\nSample request to retrieve flows for verifying completion of initial cartridge deployment:\n\n```Curl\n  curl -X GET -u \"apikey:{apikey}\" \\\n  --header \"Accept: application/json\" \\\n  \"{url}/v1/flows?version=2017-10-13\"\n```\n\n* For updates to a previously deployed cartridge and to verify successful deployment of a cartridge in general upon a deployment request timeout, run some sample text through the _POST /v1/analyze_ API and verify that the response adheres to the configurations defined within your cartridge.\n\n## Missing Medical Codes\n\nMedical codes are supported as of the 2018AA version of the UMLS library. Ensure you are using the 2018AA or higher version of UMLS.
