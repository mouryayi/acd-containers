For additional planning and installation details, see:\n\n- [Plan for your installation](https://ibm.github.io/acd-containers/planning/namespace), such as preparing for persistent storage, considering security options, and planning for performance and capacity.\n- [Install ACD](https://ibm.github.io/acd-containers/installing/installing/#overview), such as creating a namespace, creating secrets, [installing the catalog](https://ibm.github.io/acd-containers/installing/installing/#add-the-acd-operator-to-the-catalog), [installing the operator](https://ibm.github.io/acd-containers/installing/installing/#install-the-acd-operator), and [installing the ACD service](https://ibm.github.io/acd-containers/installing/installing/#install-the-acd-service).\n\n## Resources Required\n\nBy default, an ACD installation requires the following minimum resources:\n\n| Component               | Number of worker nodes | CPU/node | Memory/node (G)  |\n| ----------------------- | ---------------------- | -------- | ---------------- |\n| ACD                     | 3                      | 8 min (16 recommended )       | 64              |\n\nFor high availability run 3 replicas of the ACD service on a minimum of 3 worker nodes that have 16 CPU/node and 64 GB of memory. For a development or test environment, 1 or 2 replicas can be configured and 8 CPU/node may be used.  \n\nBy default the ACD pods may use all of the CPUs on a node. If needed, you can limit the ACD deployment CPU usage (see [Configuration](../../management/configuring)).\n\nThese are the requirements for ACD. The cluster itself has additional requirements for master, infrastructure and possible additional worker node for monitoring, logging and other components or applications being run. Please see the [OpenShift recommended host practices](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.7/scalability_and_performance/recommended-host-practices.html) for guidance on adding infrastructure nodes and moving resources to those nodes.\n","type":"Mdx","contentDigest":"b2337ac15cb07479149f9eaffaf69d8a","owner":"gatsby-plugin-mdx","counter":209},"frontmatter":{"title":"Prerequisites","excerpt":"Prerequisites for installing IBM ACD.","categories":"installing","slug":"prerequisites","toc":true},"excerpt":"Prerequisites for installing IBM ACD.","exports":{},"rawBody":"---\ntitle: \"Prerequisites\"\nexcerpt: \"Prerequisites for installing IBM ACD.\"\ncategories: installing\nslug: prerequisites\ntoc: true\n---\n\nIBM Watson Annotator for Clinical Data (ACD) Container Edition has the following prerequisites:\n\n- Red Hat Openshift Container Platform (OCP) 4.7 or later\n  - Commencing with OpenShift Container Platform 4.8, Red Hat will denote all even numbered minor releases (eg 4.8, 4.10, 4.12) as Extended Update Support (EUS) releases.
