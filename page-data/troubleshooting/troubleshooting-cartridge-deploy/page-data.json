The default annotator flow is the last artifact created during the deployment process and its existence signals completion of deployment in the initial deployment of a cartridge.\n\nSample request to retrieve flows for verifying completion of initial cartridge deployment:\n\n```Curl\n  curl -X GET --header \"Authorization: Bearer xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx\" \\\n  --header \"Accept: application/json\" \\\n  \"<route_host>/v1/flows?version=2017-10-13\"\n```\n\n* For updates to a previously deployed cartridge and to verify successful deployment of a cartridge in general upon a deployment request timeout, run some sample text through the _POST /v1/analyze_ API and verify that the response adheres to the configurations defined within your cartridge.\n","type":"Mdx","contentDigest":"7f5efb69c6155b030058c8aad328ef2b","owner":"gatsby-plugin-mdx","counter":231},"frontmatter":{"title":"Troubleshooting Cartridge Deploy","excerpt":".","categories":"troubleshooting","slug":"troubleshooting","toc":true},"excerpt":".","exports":{},"rawBody":"---\ntitle: \"Troubleshooting Cartridge Deploy\"\nexcerpt: \".\"\ncategories: troubleshooting\nslug: troubleshooting\ntoc: true\n---\n\n## Cartridge Deployment Timeout\n\nSome large cartridge deployments can exceed the request timeout thresholds.
