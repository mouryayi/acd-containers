Annotator for Clinical Data uses clinical NLP trained models to extract key concepts from natural language text, such as conditions, medications, allergies, and procedures along with their associated medical codes (eg: ICD-10, RxNorm, Snomed, LOINC). These features are enriched with deep contextual insights, along with values for key clinical attributes, in order to provide a more complete view of the data at hand. Potential data sources include a variety of healthcare and life sciences sources, such as clinical notes, discharge summaries, clinical trial protocols, and literature data.\n\nThis program supports English-only text for insight extraction.\n\n[Try it Now](https://acd-try-it-out.mybluemix.net/preview)\n\n## Features\n\n### Clinical Insights\n\nThe [clinical insights](/clouddocs/clinical_insights_overview/) feature is a ready-to-use annotation capability within IBM Watson Annotator for Clinical Data that provides critical contextual information for problems, procedures, and medications identified in the text.\n\n### Clinical Coding\n\nIdentify and code clinical concepts with support for SNOMED CT, RxNorm, ICD-10-PCS, CPT, NCI, MESH, and LOINC.\n\n### Flexible Annotators\n\nThe medical domain NLP service features a variety of annotators for detecting metadata (such as entities, concepts, concept values, negated spans, hypothetical spans)\nand a collection of annotators that detect, normalize, and code medical and social findings from unstructured clinical data. Multiple annotators can be employed\nto analyze unstructured data from a single request.\n\n## How it works\n\nIBM Watson Annotator for Clinical Data is a REST API service that detects medical concepts within unstructured data.\nWhen you send unstructured data to the service to be analyzed and designate the desired annotators to employ,\nthe service will route your unstructured data through the designated annotators and return the medical concepts detected within your unstructured data.\n\n1. Designate which [available annotators](/clouddocs/overview/#Available-Annotators) to employ in analyzing your unstructured data.\n   This designation is defined as an annotator flow. See [Analyzing Text](/clouddocs/analyze_text/) for more details.\n\n2. Send your unstructured data along with the annotator flow to the service to extract the desired medical concepts.\n\n3. The service will return a JSON response with extracted insights from the unstructured text analysis based on requested annotator flow.\n\n## IBM Watson Annotator for Clinical Data Container Edition Overview\n\nThe container edition of IBM Watson Annotator for Clinical data is provided as a Kubernetes operator and set of container images that allow you to deploy, configure and manage Annotator for Clinical Data instances on your own Kubernetes cluster.  This documentation provides the [Planning](../../planning/namespace/) and  [Installation](../../installing/prereqs/) instructions to get started.\nIBM Watson Annotator for Clinical Data itself consists of a top level \"macro\" or orchestration Annotator for Clinical Data service which provides the REST api endpoints and a set of local micro services that provide the analytics or annotators that are invoked with specific parameters and in a specified order during analyze calls.   These are provided as kubernetes container images and the operator creates and manages the deployment of these.\nThe analytics of text is a stateless operation with nothing stored but configuration is stored in a local shared file system or object storage.\nThe following shows this setup with an optional security proxy that can be setup.\n\n![IBM Watson Annotator for Clinical Data Container Edition](../../images/ACD-OCP-HLD.png)\n\n## Customizing Annotator for Clinical Data analytics\n\nAnnotator for Clinical Data provides a set of of predefined configurations you can install to use with your local ACD instance.  See [Using ACD](../../usage/getting-started/) for setup instructions after installing Annotator for Clinical Data.
